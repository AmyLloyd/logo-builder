# logo-builder

## Description
The motivation for creating this logo builder was to begin to explore graphics development. SVG files are a great place to start because they are such simple files that use vectors and a small amount of memory. 

This project supports business owners to develop their own customised logos. They can use these logos in many places including online and in print format for small letter heads and business cards. 

The development of this app introduced me to SVG files, challenged my continuing development in the flow of code, use of promises and the passing of values through function parameters and arguments. The uses of Classes was a large component of this app which allowed the code to be reduced to a DRY format where switch functions and inheritance was used to move through shared code in efficient ways.
